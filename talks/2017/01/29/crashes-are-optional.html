<p>It was a boring tuesday/wednesday afternoon, co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/giridharvc7">Giridhar</a> pinged me. He was the
organizer for <a href="https://swiftindia.github.io/swiftindia/">Swift India</a> meetups. He invited me to give a talk.
As I am in trying to doing things that I havenâ€™t done before, I accepted readily.</p>

<p>About 60-66 people turned out for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SwiftChennai/events/236837342/">meetup</a>. It was fun and great learning experience to share what you know with others. 
It also exposed where I have to concentrate to develop my public speaking skills.</p>

<p>Here are the slides for the talk. I will try to put up the playground file later.</p>
