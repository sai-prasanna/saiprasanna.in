I research reinforcement learning for robotics in the Robot learning lab at the University of Freiburg. My work focuses on generalization for reinforcement learning applied to robotics.

I have previously worked on applied research in NLP to build solutions for agara.ai and Zoho. I also have research experience, publishing two papers to top NLP conferences (EMNLP) and workshops (SEMEVAL).
