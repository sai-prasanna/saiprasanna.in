<h2 id="key-idea">Key Idea</h2>

<p>Parse questions of visual QA into a description of compositions of functions. These functions are neural networks called Neural Modules. Execute the neural networks and reweigh the resulting label using question representation.</p>

<h2 id="task---visual-question-answering">Task - Visual Question Answering</h2>
<p>Given a question like “What color is the coffee mug?” and an image we want to predict the answer.</p>

<p><img src="https://visualqa.org/static/img/vqa_examples.jpg" alt="4  visual qa examples. One example: Two images having a man and women. One with man wearing glasses and another image with woman wearing glasses.Question, &quot;Who is wearing glasses?&quot; and respective answer below the image" /></p>

<h2 id="prior-approaches">Prior approaches</h2>
<ul>
  <li>End to End neural networks
    <ul>
      <li>Use a CNN to vectorize the image and RNN to vectorize the question and use a feed forward network to classify the answer.</li>
      <li>This is a black box trying to answer in one shot.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Semantic Parsing approach
    <ul>
      <li>Parse the question into logical expressions, image into logical representation of the world and use logic based reasoning to solve the problem.</li>
      <li>This is more compositional.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Combine the representational capacity of neural nets and compositionality of symbolic approach.</li>
  <li>So, “Rather than thinking of question answering as a problem of learning a single function to map from questions and contexts to answers, it’s perhaps useful
to think of it as a highly-multitask learning setting, where
each problem instance is associated with a novel task, and
the  identity  of  that  task  is  expressed  only  noisily  in  language.”</li>
  <li>Simple example - “Is this a truck?” - Needs single task to be performed, namely truck or not classification.</li>
  <li>Compositional example - “What is the object to the left of the tea pot?” - Needs one to find the teapot, detect object to its left, then classify the object.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="neural-modules">Neural Modules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identify set of modules that can be composed to solve all/most tasks.</li>
  <li>Modules can be thought of as a function parametrized by a neural network, with a type signature.</li>
  <li>Data Types - Image, Unnormalized attention map, labels

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strings---modules">Strings -&gt; Modules</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Use few rules on dependency parse of the question to convert it into a structured query.</li>
      <li>e.g. “Is there a circle next to a square?” -&gt;  is(circle, next-to(square))</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Layout</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>“All leaves become attend modules, all internal nodes become
re-attend or combine modules dependent on their arity, and root nodes become measure modules for yes/no questions and classify modules for all other question types.”
        <ul>
          <li>The queries could come from anywhere not just natural language question. As long as they can be converted to a layout in the end.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="answering">Answering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An RNN is used to process the question and predict a label directly without looking into the image.</li>
  <li>This is combined with the final label from the root node of the Neural Modules using geometric mean to get the final result.</li>
  <li>This is done for 2 reasons
    <ul>
      <li>Syntactic Regularity/Prior
        <ul>
          <li>When converting to structured query, certain syntactic elements are lost.</li>
          <li>For e.g. What is in the sky? and What are in the sky?  both result in what(fly).</li>
          <li>But answer varies from kite to kites.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Semantic Regularity/Prior
        <ul>
          <li>Some answers are unreasonable just by inspecting the question.
            <ul>
              <li>For example, What colour is the bear? eliminates all non-colour answers.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They try this in vqa dataset - https://visualqa.org/ a huge dataset with natural images and questions with answers.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Since VQA doesn’t have many deep compositional questions, they use shapes a synthetically generated dataset.
