<p>The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that big Deep Neural Nets train better than smaller nets because they get lucky. Essentially like someone who has purchased more number of lottery tickets.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prune a large neural network by zeroing the bottom x% of weights by magnitude. This can be done one shot or iteratively while training.</li>
<li>Reset the obtained subnetwork weights to the exact weights you randomly intialized before training the large neural network.</li>
<li>The pruned subnetwork converges to similar test error rate as the full network or even better in the same number of epochs.</li>
<li>The authors notice that if you were try some other initialization for the subnetwork or even sample from similar distribution it doesn’t work. Hence they hypothesise that the larger network essentially got lucky.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though the subnetwork is smaller, computations will need sparse matrix multiplication optimizations to be faster.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quantum-computing-for-the-very-curious"><a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">Quantum Computing for the Very Curious</a></h3>
<p>I wanted to try out Micheal Nielsen’s (of neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com fame) Quantum computing article. This long-form educational article attempts a unique teaching method by embedding flash cards (anki cards) and reminding readers via email to revisit the cards. I got around doing it at behest of the amzing Professor Balaji (a teacher of mine) who gave this as an exercise to test Linear Algebra understanding. Prior knowledge of the truly abstract nature of linear algebra (basis, linear transformations, linear combinations) really helped me to grok the essay.</p>
<p>The learning approach taken by this article (embedding flash cards + reminders) article shows how computing medium can be extended to augment our understanding. This scratches the surface of Alan Kay’s vision of computers being tools that extend our mind.</p>

<p>Platonism vs Aristotelianism is an age old debate in philosophy. Professor Balaji (a teacher of mine) had a strong notion that the current mathematics we have is strongly influenced by our spatio-visual sense. Stumbled upon the above post which makes similar claims. It claims that certain cognitive priors are necessary to converge upon ideas which some consider as universal.</p>
<p>I don’t know enough to lean on any side of the debate heavily. But my intution lies with universality/platonism of physics, mathematics and computatability. I think even if Alien’s use some other metaphors to arrive at Lambda Calculus, the underlying notion of universal computability (if correct) will be the same.</p>

<p>I am now exploring search systems over neural net generated representation (vector spaces). This generally involves approximate methods such as Locality senstive Hashing. The method described in this post was interestingly derived from the sense of smell of fruit-flies. This lends some weight top the notion that our cognitive reliance on certain senses (vision) makes some ideas intutive, but exploring outside it can expand our horizons. (Purely my speculation to be taken with a grain of salt.)</p>

<p>To eliminate errors make them impossible in runtime is a mantra I stand behind. Programming Patterns that are finally entering mainstream (after stewing in the academic functional world) such as Optional are moving errors to compile time. Among the patterns, type state caught my eye. Using rust’s borrow checker and other langauge features allows one to build compile time state machines. They can be as simple as allowing the compiler to disallow methods such as read on file references that are closed. Or it can be taken one step beyond to write a full blown state machines that track the current state in compile time. ie Say you have an API that needs a handshake to be performed before sending, you can ensure in compile time that the “send” method can be called only after “handshake” is called. How awesome is that.</p>

<p>This article explains what the usally hyped functional programming concept of monad solves for a imperative programmer. I have not dived deeply into any functional language yet. Seeing how even weakly adopted fucntional programming concepts such as Optionals (algebraic data types) and Optional Chaining (which is a monad) makes me question what is the cost with which the programming world is ignoring Functional paradigmn. Are the functional languages difficult to learn, or is it exposure bias towards imperative languages? Or do we need the functional abstractions to be put in better terms for people to grok them? Only time will tell.</p>
