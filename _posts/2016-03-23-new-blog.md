Github.com allows us to upload just templates, config and theme for jekyll static blog generator,
and  it generates a static website for you. 

Now you can just write a markdown file, and commit it, or even create a file
online even in github's source browser, and it is automatically generated into a blog post just after the commit is
made.

I didn't notice  this feature in github.com before. I thought we had to run jekyll locally to build static site, and 
commit it for github to serve stuff. So rather went for python static blog generator called pelican, but gave up
because of it being a pain to generate blog every time. I even tried to setup travis-ci to automagically generate
the blog, but it was slow and was still a pain.

So if you want to create a blog, just use github , it is quite easy to setup. clone a theme, edit _config.yml
and blog on.
