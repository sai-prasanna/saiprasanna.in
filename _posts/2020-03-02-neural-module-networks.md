## Key Idea

Parse questions of visual QA into a description of compositions of functions. These functions are neural networks called Neural Modules. Execute the neural networks and reweigh the resulting label using question representation.

## Task - Visual Question Answering
Given a question like "What color is the coffee mug?" and an image we want to predict the answer.

![4  visual qa examples. One example: Two images having a man and women. One with man wearing glasses and another image with woman wearing glasses.Question, "Who is wearing glasses?" and respective answer below the image](https://visualqa.org/static/img/vqa_examples.jpg)

## Prior approaches
- End to End neural networks
    - Use a CNN to vectorize the image and RNN to vectorize the question and use a feed forward network to classify the answer.
    - This is a black box trying to answer in one shot.
- Semantic Parsing approach
    - Parse the question into logical expressions, image into logical representation of the world and use logic based reasoning to solve the problem.
    - This is more compositional.

## Motivation
- Combine the representational capacity of neural nets and compositionality of symbolic approach.
- So, "Rather than thinking of question answering as a problem of learning a single function to map from questions and contexts to answers, itâ€™s perhaps useful
to think of it as a highly-multitask learning setting, where
each problem instance is associated with a novel task, and
the  identity  of  that  task  is  expressed  only  noisily  in  language."
- Simple example - "Is this a truck?" - Needs single task to be performed, namely truck or not classification.
- Compositional example - "What is the object to the left of the tea pot?" - Needs one to find the teapot, detect object to its left, then classify the object.

## Architecture

### Neural Modules
- Identify set of modules that can be composed to solve all/most tasks.
- Modules can be thought of as a function parametrized by a neural network, with a type signature.
- Data Types - Image, Unnormalized attention map, labels

    - ![Combination module](/assets/images/neural-module-networks/5.png)
    - ![Measurement Module](/assets/images/neural-module-networks/6.png)

### Strings -> Modules
- **Parsing**
    - Use few rules on dependency parse of the question to convert it into a structured query.
    - e.g. "Is there a circle next to a square?" ->  is(circle, next-to(square))
- **Layout**
    - "All leaves become attend modules, all internal nodes become
re-attend or combine modules dependent on their arity, and root nodes become measure modules for yes/no questions and classify modules for all other question types."
        - The queries could come from anywhere not just natural language question. As long as they can be converted to a layout in the end.

### Answering
- An RNN is used to process the question and predict a label directly without looking into the image.
- This is combined with the final label from the root node of the Neural Modules using geometric mean to get the final result.
- This is done for 2 reasons
    - Syntactic Regularity/Prior
        - When converting to structured query, certain syntactic elements are lost.
        - For e.g. What is in the sky? and What are in the sky?  both result in what(fly).
        - But answer varies from kite to kites.
    - Semantic Regularity/Prior
        - Some answers are unreasonable just by inspecting the question.
            - For example, What colour is the bear? eliminates all non-colour answers.

## Benchmarks
- They try this in vqa dataset - https://visualqa.org/ a huge dataset with natural images and questions with answers.
    - ![Benchmarks table for VQA](https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/21c99706bb26e9012bfb4d8d48009a3d45af59b2/7-Table3-1.png)
- Since VQA doesn't have many deep compositional questions, they use shapes a synthetically generated dataset.

## Examples
- What colour is his tie? ![Statue of a man with yellow tie, question parsed to modules 1. find tie  2. describe colour ](https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/21c99706bb26e9012bfb4d8d48009a3d45af59b2/5-Figure2-1.png)
