It was a boring tuesday/wednesday afternoon, co-worker [Giridhar](https://twitter.com/giridharvc7) pinged me. He was the
organizer for [Swift India](https://swiftindia.github.io/swiftindia/) meetups. He invited me to give a talk.
As I am in trying to doing things that I haven't done before, I accepted readily.

About 60-66 people turned out for the [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SwiftChennai/events/236837342/). It was fun and great learning experience to share what you know with others. 
It also exposed where I have to concentrate to develop my public speaking skills.

Here are the slides for the talk. I will try to put up the playground file later.
